Go implementation of multiple perceptual hash algorithms for images. The source code has been ported from [OpenCV Contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib).

### Supported algorithms

- Average hash
- Difference hash
- Median hash
- Block Mean Value hash
- pHash
- Marr-Hildreth hash
- Radial Variance hash
- Color Moments hash

### TODO
